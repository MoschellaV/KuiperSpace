## ðŸ“„ About The Project & Inspo
Space is cool so I decided to make a game themed around it. This was actually a high school end of year project for my computer science class. A lot of my peers played the game and I gave a prize _gift card_,to the person first on the leaderboard!

<br/>

### ðŸš€ Features

- **Player-controller:** Movement mechanics takes into account drift and zero air resistance.
- **Unique ships & abilities:** Three custom made unique ships each having their own ability to destroy or protect you from enemy asteroids.
- **Public Leaderboard:** A public leaderboard that allows players to publish their score and compete with other players.
- **Enemy algorithm:** Enemy algorithm follow players, with each enemy having different sizes and speeds.
- **Scoring system:** Points are earned from destroying enemy asteroids, with each enemy worth different points.
- **Nice visuals:** Appealing 2D graphics and engaging special effects.

<br/>

### ðŸ’» Tech Used
Here's the tech the game uses:

- [**Unity**](https://unity.com/) game engine used for development, providing a powerful and flexible framework for creating 2D games.
- [**C#**](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/languages/csharp) programming language used for scripting game logic and behaviors.
- [**Pixlr**](https://pixlr.com/suite/) used for creating and editing visual assets such as sprites and backgrounds.

<br/>

### ðŸ§  What I Learned
While creating this project I learned a lot about game development, from the game design and balancing to actual technical implementation. Prior to this project I had never used Unity or worked with C#, nonetheless I think the project turned out pretty good. I got to work on my Object-Oriented-Programming skills implementing various game features. In addition to this I also got comfortable working with animation creation and Unity's particle system. Overall this project taught me a lot, implementing the leaderboard was a great addition too. It made the game more competitive and gave my friends something to do in those boring high school classes.
